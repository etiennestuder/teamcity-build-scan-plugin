# Overview

[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) plugin that integrates with the Build Scan service and more generally with Gradle Enterprise for Gradle and Maven builds run via TeamCity. Build scans are available as a free service on [scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/) and commercially via [Gradle Enterprise](https://gradle.com/enterprise).

For each Gradle and Maven build that is run from TeamCity, this plugin exposes the links to the created build scans in the TeamCity UI. The plugin can also be configured to ad-hoc connect Gradle and Maven builds to an existing Gradle Enterprise instance such that a Build Scan is published each time a build is run from TeamCity.

The plugin is available from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9326-integration-for-gradle-and-maven-build-scans).

# Integrations

## Build Scan links surfacing

### Gradle builds

If you use TeamCity's _Gradle_ runner to launch your Gradle builds, there is nothing special to do.

If you use TeamCity's _Command Line_ runner to launch your Gradle builds, you can opt in to enable build scan detection using the `buildScanPlugin.command-line-build-step.enabled` configuration parameter.

If the first two mechanisms will not work for your Gradle build configurations, you can still get integration with build scans, but it requires your build logs being parsed for build scan links. In case of huge build logs, this can put a significant toll on the performance of your TeamCity instance. You can enable the parsing of the build logs by setting the `buildScanPlugin.log-parsing.enabled` configuration parameter to _true_.

### Maven builds

If you use TeamCity's _Maven_ runner to launch Maven builds, there is nothing special to do.

If you use TeamCity's _Command Line_ runner to launch your Maven builds, you can opt in to enable build scan detection using the `buildScanPlugin.command-line-build-step.enabled` configuration parameter.

If the first two mechanisms will not work for your Maven build configurations, you can still get integration with build scans, but it requires your build logs being parsed for build scan links. In case of huge build logs, this can put a significant toll on the performance of your TeamCity instance. You can enable the parsing of the build logs by setting the `buildScanPlugin.log-parsing.enabled` configuration parameter to _true_.

## Gradle Enterprise connectivity

You can ad-hoc connect Gradle and Maven builds to an existing Gradle Enterprise instance by automatically injecting the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) and the [Gradle Enterprise Maven extension](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/) when these builds are run via TeamCity's _Gradle_ or _Maven_ runner. If a Gradle or Maven build is run via TeamCity's _Command Line_ runner the auto-injection can be opted in to, too. If a given build is already connected to Gradle Enterprise, the auto-injection is skipped.

The same auto-injection behavior is available for the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) and the [Common Custom User Data Maven extension](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension).

The higher in TeamCity's project hierarchy the required configuration parameters are applied, the more widely they apply since the configuration parameters are passed on to all child projects. Child projects can override the configuration parameters of their parent projects and even disable the auto-injection by setting the appropriate configuration parameters to empty values.

For convenience, the configuration parameter values can be defined through a form describing a Gradle Enterprise connection. Alternatively, the configuration parameter values can be defined as TeamCity configuration parameters.

### Configuration via TeamCity connection

A Gradle Enterprise connection can be created in the Connections section of the configuration of a given project. In the Add Connection dropdown, select the Gradle Enterprise connection type.

Fill out the Add Connection dialog with the URL for the Gradle Enterprise instance, the plugin and extension versions to be applied, and any other fields as needed. Some values, such as the plugin and extension versions, will be pre-populated.

A Gradle Enterprise connection can be created on any project and is automatically inherited by all its child projects.

### Configuration via TeamCity configuration parameters

As an alternative to the configuration via a TeamCity connection, you can describe the configuration via TeamCity configuration parameters on a given project.

The TeamCity configuration parameters can be set on any project and are automatically inherited by all its child projects.

#### Gradle Builds

1. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to apply Gradle Enterprise, create three configuration parameters:

   - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.url` - the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which to publish build scans
   - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.plugin.version` - the version of the [Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) to apply
   - `buildScanPlugin.ccud.plugin.version` - the version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to apply (optional)

2. If required, provide additional configuration parameters for your environment (optional):

    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.allow-untrusted-server` - allow communication with an untrusted server; set to _true_ if your Gradle Enterprise instance is using a self-signed certificate
    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.enforce-url` - enforce the configured Gradle Enterprise URL over a URL configured in the project's build; set to _true_ to enforce publication of build scans to the configured Gradle Enterprise URL
    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle.plugin-repository.url` - the URL of the repository to use when resolving the GE and CCUD plugins; required if your TeamCity agents are not able to access the Gradle Plugin Portal
    - `buildScanPlugin.command-line-build-step.enabled` - enable Gradle Enterprise integration for _Command Line_ build steps; by default only steps using the _Gradle_ runner are enabled

##### Example Gradle Configuration

#### Maven Builds

1. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to integrate Gradle Enterprise, create three configuration parameters:

   - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.url` - the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which to publish build scans
   - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.extension.version` - the version of the [Gradle Enterprise Maven extension](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/) to apply
   - `buildScanPlugin.ccud.extension.version` - the version of the [Common Custom User Data Maven extension](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension) to apply (optional)

2. If required, provide additional configuration parameters for your environment (optional):

    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.allow-untrusted-server` - allow communication with an untrusted server; set to _true_ if your Gradle Enterprise instance is using a self-signed certificate
    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.enforce-url` - enforce the configured Gradle Enterprise URL over a URL configured in the project's build; set to _true_ to enforce publication of build scans to the configured Gradle Enterprise URL
    - `buildScanPlugin.gradle-enterprise.extension.custom.coordinates` - the coordinates of a custom extension that has a transitive dependency on the Gradle Enterprise Maven Extension
    - `buildScanPlugin.ccud.extension.custom.coordinates` - the coordinates of a custom Common Custom User Data Maven Extension or of a custom extension that has a transitive dependency on it
    - `buildScanPlugin.command-line-build-step.enabled` - enable Gradle Enterprise integration for _Command Line_ build steps; by default only steps using the _Maven_ runner are enabled

## Slack notifications (experimental)

1. In Slack, create a webhook and keep track of the created URL.

2. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to be notified about published build scans, create a configuration parameter with name `buildScanPlugin.slack-webhook.url` and the value being the URL of the webhook created in step #1.

3. Trigger your Gradle builds with build scans enabled.

4. Find a notification about the published build scans in the Slack channel configured in the webhook.

# Compatibility

## Build Scan links surfacing

The version of the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin and the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension that are applied to a build must meet a minimum version requirement for the link surfacing to work.

| TC Build Scan plugin version | Minimum supported GE Maven extension version | Minimum supported GE Gradle plugin version |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0.23+                        | 1.11                                         | 3.0  (or Gradle Build Scan plugin 1.8)     |
| 0.22                         | 1.0                                          | 3.0  (or Gradle Build Scan plugin 1.8)     |

## Gradle Enterprise connectivity

The configured version of the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin and the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension that get automatically applied by the TeamCity Build Scan plugin must be compatbile with the version of the Gradle Enterprise server that the build is connecting to.

### Gradle builds

The compatibility of the specified version of the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin with Gradle Enterprise can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#gradle_enterprise_gradle_plugin). The compatibility of the optionally specified version of the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin with the Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin#version-compatibility).

### Maven builds

The compatibility of the specified version of the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension with Gradle Enterprise can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#gradle_enterprise_compatibility_2). The compatibility of the optionally specified version of the Common Custom User Data Maven extension with the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension can be found [here](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension#version-compatibility).

For Maven builds, the version of the Gradle Enterprise Maven extension automatically applied by the TeamCity Build Scan plugin is currently bundled by the plugin and cannot be configured. This will change in a future version of this plugin.
