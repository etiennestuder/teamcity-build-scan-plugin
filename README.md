# Overview

[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) plugin that integrates with build scans for Gradle and Maven. Build scans are available as a free service on [scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/) and commercially via [Gradle Enterprise](https://gradle.com/enterprise).

For each Gradle and Maven build that is run from TeamCity, this plugin exposes the links to the created build scans in the TeamCity UI.

The plugin is available from the [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9326-integration-for-gradle-and-maven-build-scans).

## Build scan

Find out more about build scans for Gradle and Maven at https://scans.gradle.com.

## Version compatibility

### <=0.22
These plugin versions require that you use at least Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin 3.0 or Gradle Build Scan plugin 1.8 in your Gradle builds, or Gradle Enterprise Maven extension 1.0 in your Maven builds.

### >=0.23
These plugin versions require that you use at least Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin 3.0 or Gradle Build Scan plugin 1.8 in your Gradle builds, or Gradle Enterprise Maven extension 1.11 in your Maven builds.

It is recommended that you use the [latest Gradle Enterprise Gradle plugin version](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise) or
[latest Gradle Build Scan plugin version](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.build-scan) and the
[latest Gradle Enterprise Maven extension version](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:gradle-enterprise-maven-extension) at all times to get the most insights from your builds.

## TeamCity build runner requirements

### Gradle builds

If you use TeamCity's GradleRunner to launch your Gradle builds, there is nothing special to do.

If, and only if, you do not use TeamCity's GradleRunner to launch Gradle builds, apply the [TeamCity build scan Gradle plugin](https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-build-scan-teamcity-plugin) to your Gradle builds in order to
notify TeamCity about the build scans that were published while running a build.

If you do not use TeamCity's GradleRunner to launch Gradle builds and you do not apply the [TeamCity build scan Gradle plugin](https://github.com/etiennestuder/gradle-build-scan-teamcity-plugin) to your Gradle builds, you can still get integration with build scans, but it requires your build logs being parsed for build scan links. In case of huge build logs, this can put a significant toll on the performance of your TeamCity instance. You can enable the parsing of the build logs by creating a TeamCity configuration parameter with name `BUILD_SCAN_LOG_PARSING` and setting the value to `true`.

### Maven builds

If you use TeamCity's MavenRunner to launch Maven builds, there is nothing special to do.

If you do not use TeamCity's MavenRunner to launch Maven builds, you can still get integration with build scans, but it requires your build logs being parsed for build scan links. In case of huge build logs, this can put a significant toll on the performance of your TeamCity instance. You can enable the parsing of the build logs by creating a TeamCity configuration parameter with name `BUILD_SCAN_LOG_PARSING` and setting the value to `true`.

# Installation

## Option 1: Conveniently select plugin

1. Go to the plugin list of your TeamCity installation at `<TeamCityInstanceRootUrl>/admin/admin.html?item=plugins` and browse the plugins repository.
2. Select, install, and activate the plugin as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/installing-additional-plugins.html#Installing+a+plugin+from+JetBrains+Plugins+repository).

## Option 2: Manually upload plugin

1. Download the plugin `.zip` file from [https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9326-integration-for-gradle-and-maven-build-scans](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9326-integration-for-gradle-and-maven-build-scans).

1. Go to the plugin list of your TeamCity installation at `<TeamCityInstanceRootUrl>/admin/admin.html?item=plugins` and click on the link _Upload plugin zip_ to install the
previously downloaded plugin `.zip` file.

1. Restart TeamCity.

1. Trigger your Gradle builds with build scans enabled.

1. Find the links of the published build scans in the _Overview_ section of each TeamCity build.

## Gradle Enterprise Integration

### Gradle Builds

1. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to apply Gradle Enterprise, create 3 configuration parameters:

   - `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL` - the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which you want to publish build scans.
   - `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION` - the version of the Gradle Enterprise plugin to apply to the build.
   - `CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION` - the version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to apply to the build.

1. Trigger your Gradle build.

1. Find the links of the published build scans in the _Overview_ section of each TeamCity build.

### Maven Builds

1. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to integrate Gradle Enterprise, create 3 configuration parameters:

   - `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL` - the URL of the Gradle Enterprise instance to which you want to publish build scans. If set, this will override the definition of an existing Gradle Enterprise server url.
   - `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_EXTENSION_VERSION` - the version of the Gradle Enterprise extension to apply to the build.
   - `CCUD_EXTENSION_VERSION` - the version of the [Common Custom User Data Maven extension](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension) to apply to the build.

1. Trigger your Maven build.

1. Find the links of the published build scans in the _Overview_ section of each TeamCity build.

_Note: The Gradle Enterprise and Common Custom User Data Maven extensions are currently hard-coded to versions 1.14 and 1.10.1, respectively._

## Slack Integration

1. In Slack, create a webhook and keep track of the created URL.

1. In TeamCity, on the build configuration for which you want to be notified about published build scans, create a configuration parameter with name `BUILD_SCAN_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and the value being the URL of the webhook created in step #1.

1. Trigger your Gradle builds with build scans enabled.

1. Find a notification about the published build scans in the Slack channel configured in the webhook.
